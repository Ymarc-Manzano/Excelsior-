					<p>Marvel Studios has, yet again, enthralled comic fans, Marvel geeks, and moviegoers alike with the recent world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ with critics calling it one of the best that Marvel has unveiled. Rated as 98% ‘Certified Fresh’ in Rotten Tomatoes (topping ‘Iron Man’ who sat at 94%), here is a non-spoilery review of the new entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the solo big-screen debut of Black Panther.</p>
				<div class="space">
				</div>
					<h2 id="sub1">A Glimpse Into the Plot </h2>
					<p>The film takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War where T’Challa, now the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), is to return to the African nation of Wakanda to take the mantle of king following the death of his father. This does not come easy though as others also have their eyes set on the throne and on Wakanda. Enter Erik Killmonger, portrayed by Michael Jordan, the film’s main big bad whose ideals contradict what Wakanda has been trying to preserve from the outside world for years – their culture and treasure.</p>
				
				<div class="space1">
				</div>
					<h2 id="sub1">Cinematic Eye-candy</h2>
					<p>Arguably Marvel Studios’ most visually-appealing film to date, ‘Black Panther’ introduces a new take in their cinematic franchise with the story of Black Panther and the setting of Wakanda – a nation rich in technological advancements powered by the rarest and strongest metal on earth (Vibranium) that is cloaked from the entire world who thinks of it as the opposite, a third-world country. Given its isolation, Wakanda, in its fully fleshed-out eye-candy CGI, still feels very much grounded with the rest of the world as portrayed in the culture that has been carefully and beautifully crafted onto a film that truly captures the African feel.</p>
					<p>The movie wonderfully executes the combination of real-world African culture with that of the modern, or as they call it, Afrofuturistic, in this fictional universe which is what makes Wakanda stand out above the rest of what the MCU has showcased in the past. Add to this, the stunning set designs matched with the vivid and intricate costumes give the movie a pop of color in order to bring the movie to life. This elevates the movie to a whole new level by carving its own distinct style. The eye-catching cinematography of flashy colors has been a recent trend for the franchise as seen in their recent films: Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and you cannot blame them for continuing it as this really pumps up the cinematic experience for moviegoers considering the fact that it is an action and sci-fi film based on comics.</p>

					<h2 id="sub1">Profound Characters</h2>
					<p>Following his big-screen debut in Civil War, the movie delves deeper into the history and character of the Black Panther and his country of origin including their customs and the government system, which the film traces down to its roots.Chadwick Boseman magnificently portrays the titular Black Panther who encompasses a character struggling with what his royal ancestry had in store for him –the throne. His character goes beyond that of a superhero; the film humanizes him into a conflicted leader whose decisions could affect the entire world. “What happens now determines what happens to the rest of the world,” as he states. This is made all the more challenging with the revelation of Erik Killmonger along with Ulysses Klaue, a character who we’ve actually already seen before in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Focusing on the film’s main antagonist, Michael Jordan’s portrayal of Killmonger undoubtedly delivers one of the best MCU villains yet who at times overshadow T’Challa himself, continuing the streak of actually-compelling villains following Vulture from Spider-Man: Homecoming and Hela from Ragnarok. His ideals are driven by his past, that of which can actually persuade viewers into sympathizing him because aside from his backstory, what he envisions is not world domination per se, which is the cliché for most comic villains; behind his extremist ways, his purpose is truly grounded upon reality, one that is even beyond Wakanda.</p>
				</div>
					<div class="characters-p3">
					<p>As for the supporting characters, they are also given the chance to shine, most especially Shuri (played by Letitia Wright) who even steals the spotlight in several occasions from the lead with her wits and by providing comic relief. The film really demonstrates how her young demeanor should not be taken lightly as her brains could even rival the great minds of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, if not already. Moving onto brawns, there’s no better representation than the women of this film. Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), Okoye (Danai Guirira), and the female warriors they call ‘Dora Milaje’ do an excellent job in driving the movie forward by breaking the damsel-in-distress persona and instead manifest characters that are hardcore and fearless; as a result, they provide some of the most exhilarating fight scenes in the fim, second only to that of Black Panther and Killmonger’s. This, however, does not eclipse the performances of Daniel Kaluuya as W’Kabi and the comical M’baku played by Winston Duke, but in the case of Angela Bassett’s Ramona (T’Challa’s mother) and Martin Freeman’s Everett Ross (CIA operative), I had hoped that their characters were explored more in the movie and not just be there for the sake of being there. This slight flaw however does not affect the course of the film. On the flipside, Andy Serkis’ portrayal of Klaue, the rogue black market dealer, should be properly credited with much appreciation as his performance unexpectedly turned out absolutely great for the film. All in all, the stellar cast did an excellent job in making the characters stand out not only in the film but also outside of it.

				<div class="a-game-changer">
					<h2 id="sub1">A Game Changer</h2>
						<p>Not since the movie ‘Blade’ (1998) has Hollywood introduced a superhero franchise with the lead starring a hero of color. This long-term drought of black representation, or minority representation for that matter, has finally been put to a halt with the release of Black Panther. The film truly showcases why black representation matters and the message it carries.
Minorities, most of the time, have long been shut down to minor roles in the film industry with the dominance of white men being a common scenario already, more so for films centered on heroism. For director-writer Ryan Coogler, he begs to disagree from the lot by bringing us Black Panther, a film that takes subjects of race, oppression, and subjugation head-on in a way that films had never done in the past and one that opens up the conversation for many. Though the elements in the film are fantasized, the issues tackled feel real and are real – some aspects of the film even make you question your morality and where you stand.
While yes, it is true that representation truly matters, this should not overshadow or downplay Coogler’s fearless vision of giving us an exciting film, one that can even stand on its own in this grand cinematic franchise. From its visual design to the thrilling soundtrack provided by Kendrick Lamar, the film delivers one of the best from Marvel and from the genre. ‘Black Panther’ takes you on a ride with its own touch of Marvel flare (including the Stan Lee cameo) but with its own distinguishable identity.
It is genre-defining movie and a game-changer not only for the franchise but also for the entire film industry.

					<h2 id="sub1">Final Say</h2>
						<p>You should definitely check this movie out even if you haven’t seen the past films in the franchise. Just like any other MCU film, I can confidently say that this will be a ‘Black’ buster hit. This film is highly recommended and one that will surely leave a mark and will leave you screaming “Wakanda Forever!”
Be sure to stay until the end of the film as in true Marvel fashion, there is a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene that ties the movie up for Avengers: Infinity War.
From Marvel Studios standards, I give this movie a rating of 4.8/5.

				</div>
				<div class="one">
					<img src="images/F4.jpg"  width="430" height="400">
					<p>Marvel’s Black Panther character made his debut in the comic book world in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 Issue 52, published in 1966.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="two">
					<img src="images/Dora-Milaje.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>An important part of the Black Panther lore incorporated into the film is the Dora Milaje, the cadre of strong fierce women who serve as the personal security force to the King and royal family. These tall, statuesque, bald warrior women, who move as one, command attention wherever they go.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="three">
					<img src="images/Dora-Milaje2.jpg" width="405" height="400">
					<p>Led by Danai Gurira’s character, Okoye, the Dora Milaje security force features an international contingent of women from all over the world, including Florence Kasumba who returns to play Ayo, a character that first appeared in Marvel Studios’ Captain America: Civil War. The Dora Milaje were cast from a pool of actresses, stunt women and Broadway dancers.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="four">
					<img src="images/chadwick.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>It was decided early on that Xhosa, one of the official languages of South Africa, would be the language of Wakanda. A precedent had been set in Marvel Studios’ Captain America: Civil War, when celebrated South African actor John Kani, who portrayed King T’Chaka, used his native accent. Chadwick Boseman, who plays T’Challa/Black Panther, picked it up from him as well.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="five">
					<img src="images/drum.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>The cast and stunt team practiced with African drums played by musician Jabari Exum so that their movements would have a musical quality found in many African-based martial arts.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="six">
					<img src="images/rhino.jpg" width="405" height="400">
					<p>Actor Daniel Kaluuya learned how to ride a horse as practice to simulate riding W’Kabi’s armored rhino in the film.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="seven">
					<img src="images/fatherson.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>South African actor Atandwa Kani plays the character of Young T’Chaka to his father and celebrated South African actor John Kani’s King T’Chaka.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="eight">
					<img src="images/bts.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>The cast did the bulk of the fight work that will be seen on film. Chadwick Boseman, whose skill set includes a comprehensive martial arts background, knew what he was in for when he and all the other actors had to attend a “boot camp” to prepare them for the physical aspects of their roles.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="nine">
					<img src="images/michael.jpg" width="405" height="400">
					<p> Michael B. Jordan, who plays Erik Killmonger, spent about two and a half hours in the special effects makeup chair every day, while makeup designer Joel Harlow and three other makeup artists applied close to 90 individually sculpted silicone moulds to his upper body. This “scarification” application process entails transferring each mould and then blending and painting them to match Jordan’s skin tone. Each of Killmonger’s scars represents a “notch” of his kills over the years.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="ten">
					<img src="images/wakanda.jpg" width="430" height="400">
					<p>The majority of the Wakanda sets were constructed on sound stages at Pinewood Studios in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council; the Wakandan Design Group, Shuri’s hive of research and development of the vibranium rich country; the ancient subterranean Hall of Kings; and most notably Warrior Falls, the ceremonial heart of Wakanda’s revered traditions.</p>
