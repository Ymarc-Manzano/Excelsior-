						<center><h4>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h4></center>
						<p>The Young Health Advocates (YSA) and the Isip at Diwa Circles of Christ the King College (CKC) joined forces in delivering the “#ShareChristToTransformLives” in
						San Agustin Elementary School through a program centered on the importance of proper hygiene, February 22.</p>
						<p>	In coordination with the Community Involvement Program (CIP) that CKC promotes, the main goal of the 
						activity was to educate the ways of proper hygiene and its benefits to the pupils of the said school, which the administrators 
						connected to the second semestral theme of the school which was to “Transform Lives.”</p>
						<p>“The pupils were very cooperative and excited with what we had prepared,” stated Ronalyn Tadifa 
						of 11-1 who was part of the Isip at Diwa circle.</p>
						<p>	The proper way of washing hands and brushing the teeth were demonstrated, 
						which the pupils later on put into action together with the aid of the circle members.</p>
						<p>“We plan on doing it again next year,” expressed Mrs. Joy Abaya.</p>
						<p>Participants of the said program also handed gifts such as dental hygiene kits and hand soaps to the pupils, 
						which they would use to put into actual effect the practices done in the program and maintain proper hygiene.	</p>

						<p>“This short program gives an avenue for us, CKCians, to reach out to the needs of the community. 
						Though it’s a little act, the smiles we receive in the end give us a sense of fulfilment,” stated Marc Jandel Buccat of 12-5.</p>
						<p>The CKCians were assisted by the corresponding coordinators: Mrs. Joy Abaya for the Isip at Diwa and Ms. Cherry Nebrida for the Young Health Advocates.</p>
						<p>All members of the circles were also given the chance to entertain the pupils by showing off their performances associated with the program’s goal,
						which made the pupils all the more excited for the program that was prepared for them.</p>
						<p>This program was in line with the monthly activity circles meeting organized by the school 
						which aims to hone students’ specializations in their respective circles. </p>

				<p>With excitement and nervousness, the grade 12 students of Christ the King College (CKC) 
				had their work immersion in different government and non-government areas and offices, Jan. 22 – Feb 2.</p>
				<p>Some of the immersionists in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) strand were tasked with paper works in
				the Department of Justice (DOJ) Region 1 - Office of the Regional Prosecutor 
				where they even had the chance to witness court trials, specifically with crime and drug-related cases. </p>
				<p>“Ten days was too short for us, but even though our time was short, in those ten days, we learned a lot of new experiences and knowledge,” 
				expressed Marc Jandel Buccat, a HUMSS student who was assigned at the DOJ.</p>
				<p>As for the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students, some were immersed in areas 
				and workplaces mostly related to the specializations of their strands, which included the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) – Environmental Management Bureau, the Red Cross, Bethany Hospital, school clinics,
				and even in the Department of Education (DepEd) regional and division offices. </p>
				<p>Those assigned in Red Cross had their first-hand experiences in first-aid training, blood releasing, blood bottling, 
				assisting in blood typing along with encoding for the receptionists in their offices. </p>

				<p>“The work immersion was a great help to us, grade 12 students, because this allowed us to be exposed with our respective fields which will helps us 
				decide our college courses.” expressed Apple Joy Bulosan, a STEM student who had the opportunity to work for Red Cross.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, some of the ABM (Accountancy and Business Management) students, were assigned in barangay offices where 
				they also did paperworks with the likes of encoding different files, ring binding, printing and photocopying.  
				At times, they accompanied barangay officers when they had to do canvassing for their projects.</p>
				<p>“The advice that I can tell to the next students who will experience their work immersion is that 
				they must always go to work early and always cooperate with your workmates,” quipped Therese Manzano, STEM student.</p>
				<p>Parents and guardians of the first-time immersionists had an orientation of where 
				their respective child would be assigned to before the work immersion started .</p>
				<p>Each student had to meet the requirement of eight hours a day for the duration of ten days in their respective areas.</p>

						<center><h4>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h4></center>
						<p>With only somewhat meager preparation according to the winners, two Senior High School CKCians bagged the first and 
						second place respectively in the “Tobacco-free World” Painting Contest held at the Bacnotan District Hospital, Feb. 26.</p>
						<p>Following her first place finish in the National Science Quest Poster Making Contest last February 9-11, 
						Francheska Lorein Fabie once again took the top spot for another Painting Contest.</p>
						<p>“The results were also surprising for me, because I wasn't that prepared for the contest. Nevertheless, it just showed that even though 
						I was unprepared, my effort to do my best was enough to win the competition,” stated Fabie of 12-2.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, Steven Ray Estabillo, also from 12-2, snatched the second 
						place out of ten competitors who came from various municipalities like San Juan and Bacnotan.</p>
						<p>"I was actually amazed by the results since I thought I had no chance of winning," uttered Estabillo.</p>
						<p>The contestants were given the time limit of two and a half hours for the competition wherein cash prizes were at stake.</p>

				<div class="main-article-continue">
						<p>The duo was coached by Mr. Rogelio Oredina, Mathematics Area Coordinator of Christ the King College (CKC) and a known artist in the 
						said school who has shared his artistry in some of the school’s past events. </p>
						<p>Fabie was given Php 3,000 for her first place finish and Php 2,000 for Estabillo.</p>
