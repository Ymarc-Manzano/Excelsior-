				<center><h4>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h4></center>
	<p>Taking part in the Olympics is the dream for most athletes - a prestigious international sporting event where competitions are held from a myriad of sports. Luckily, this dream has become a reality for Filipino athlete Michael Martinez, a figure skater who competed in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. 
	But behind the blaze and glory of taking part in the Olympics and representing his homeland, lack of support manifested in his journey, and it took a toll in our country’s performance.</p>
	<p>First of all, seldom does a Filipino athlete ever get the chance to compete in the prestigious Winter Olympics with Martinez and alpine skier Asa Miller being the only ones this year. 
	With this given, in true Filipino fashion, moral support should have been evident for the country’s representatives which is something that Filipinos have always took pride of when it comes to international pageants and bouts of ‘People’s Champ’ Manny Pacquiao. Unfortunately in this instance, it seemed to be the total opposite and it showed.</p>
	<p>In connection, there was also lack of exposure in the media. Majority did not even know that the Philippines was joining the said Olympic event. Unlike the attention given to other international competitions with pageants being a notable example, not even half of that was visible in support of Martinez who ended up finishing 28th 
	in the Short Program for Men’s Figure Skating, failing to advance in the other round of the competition.</p>

			<div class="third-article-continued">
	<p>If not for Sweden’s entry withdrawing from the competition, Martinez would have already been out for the winter games following his eighth-place finish in the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany last year, an event that also garnered meager attention. What we can take from this is that the current state of sports in the Philippines is far from global standards. 
	Insufficient facilities and financial assistance have long been the woes of athletes and they all point to one root cause, dirty politics in sports.</p>
	<p>This is made all the worse with the Philippine Sports Commission stating that sports is not a priority for the government, and athletes are the ones who suffer from this the most.</p>
	<p>The Olympics, being an internationally-renowned event, in which we are able to send our athletes, is something that our country should acknowledge more; the same also goes for the athletes themselves. Supporting those who banner our flag in a global scale with the likes of Martinez and Miller would actually help in boosting their performance. Representing our country is not and will never be an easy feat. 
	After all, their performance reflects the country of our own, so they need all the support they can get.</p>
