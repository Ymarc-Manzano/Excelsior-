				<p>Last February 9-11, Christ the King College, as representatives of San Fernando, competed in the 15th National Science Quest held at Baguio. 
				With much enthusiasm, the school took home numerous accolades, many of which were ‘firsts’ for the school. One of the contestants 
				who won was Ymarc Immanuel Manzano who bagged first place in his Science Investigatory Project - Applied Science (Individual).</p>

				<h3>Get to know his project here: </h3>
				<h2 id="title1"><center>"Potentials of Mango (Mangifera indica), Java Plum (Syzygium Cumini), and Neem (Azadirachta indica) 
				Tree  Barks as Natural Water-based Wood Stains"</center></h2>
				<h3>Objective:</h3>
				<P>To yield natural and hazard-free water-based wood stains by utilizing the barks of Mango, Java plum, and Neem trees 
				which could serve as alternatives to commercialized ones in order to minimize hazardous threats.</p>

				<h3>Significance:</h3>
				<p>Hazardous products and by-products are lessened which in turn, minimizes the threats to human health and the environment. 
				Such a study can also help those consumers, especially in the countryside or rural areas, who cannot afford commodities like this by providing them an alternative 
				which can be made easily with the least expense for their wooden furniture and/or handicrafts to have a finished look. The same goes for schools and offices. 
				Another, is that it actually encourages more trees of such to be planted for the potentials they have.</p>

				<h3 id="title2">Materials Needed:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Barks for each kind of tree – should accumulate to 50 grams</i>

				<li>Water (50 ml each)– the solvent</i>
				<li>Weighing scale – used to measure the materials</i>
				<li>Stove – for boiling</i>

				<h3 id="title3">Results:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>By utilizing the barks from the Mango, Java Plum, and Neem trees, natural and hazard-free water-based wood stains are produced;</i>
				<li>Each kind of bark, because of their differences in composition, yielded a different color, which gets darker the more it is applied;</i>
				<li>The application of these wood stains can give wooden furniture or handicrafts a better,
				more finished look which is a must for schools and offices alike;</i>
				<li>By using biodegradable materials, hazardous products and their by-products are minimized</i>

					<h1>Genomic Breakthrough: Capsids, a New Type of Packaging</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="byline2">
					<h3>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h3>
				</div>
				
			<div class="second-article">
				<p>Packaging is an important aspect when it comes to products. Take the Apple iPhone packaging for example;
				it has been meticulously designed for a pleasing aesthetic experience and 
				every feature of the packaging itself makes sure that the phone is secured in the best way possible.
				When it comes to genome editing, good packaging is even more crucial.</p>
				<p>Recently, a team of bioengineers hailing from the University of Washington has proposed a new type of packaging built to protect genetic material, 
				specifically RNA, which could be a potential life-saver for gene therapy.</p>
				<div class="second-article1">
				<h2 id="firsttitle">Design Proposals</h2>
				<p>	This designer packaging consists of proteins which self-assemble into soccer ball-like nanostructures known as capsids. 
				These tiny particles encapsulate RNA, allowing it to move around the bodies of mice (test subjects) for hours without being degraded — 
				clearing out one of the biggest challenges to successful gene editing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="second-article2">
				<h2 id="secondtitle">Delivering the Product</h2>
				<p>Utilizing a computer-guided protein design and an artificial laboratory evolution enabled the bioengineers to create a suitable encapsulating structure. 
				They were able to produce one nanostructure that engulfs RNA blueprints at a rate comparable to the best engineered AAVs (Adeno-associated virus) -
				engineered viruses were the best-received proposals in the past though they had perilous consequences.</p>
				<p>Modification of the interior surface of a computer-designed capsid allowed the RNA to stick to it. 
				By mutating this version of the capsid in the laboratory and picking out the best performing mutants, 
				they were able to identify new versions which packaged even more RNA, protected it, 
				and persisted inside mouse blood (a hostile environment for foreign RNA and proteins). 
				In other words, the team made use of one of nature's favorite strategies: evolution.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="second-article3">
				<h2 id="thirdtitle">Peer Review</h2>
				<p>As Marc Lajoie, a leading author in biotechnology and genomics, puts it, these designer capsids are still far away from use in patients, 
				but we should still remain optimistic about its future. "We certainly have plenty of work ahead of us," as he states. </p>
				<p>Moving genetic material, whether DNA or RNA, throughout the body has never been an easy task when it comes to human genome editing but with 
				the introduction of capsids, gene therapy and bioengineering breakthroughs are now closer than ever. </p>
