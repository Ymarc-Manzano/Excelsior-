						<center><h4>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h4></center>
						<p>Christ the King College (CKC) is known for being a school that upholds Catholic-rooted values and a holistic education. 
						With this in line, the school always puts forth various themes for each school year, and for this year, it was “Blazing the Fire of Love and Service: Our Call, Our Mission” with the two semestral themes: 
						“Falling Genuinely in Love with Christ” for the first semester and “Living Passionately the Love of Christ ” for the second.</p>
						<p>Now on the midst of the first semester, the underlying question now points to whether the school has truly put the said themes on the context of the school, 
						and based on what have transpired on the course of the current school year, indeed, the school has done so.</p>
						<p>Like what has been the past tradition of the school, focus-teachings and lessons centering on the themes established for the school year were administered by the teachers, specifically 
						those affiliated with the Christian Living Education (CLE) and other subjects related to it whom also launched the said themes.</p>
						<p>These were also manifested through the Eucharistic Celebrations of the school alongside the Prayer Services that of which the students and personnel
						all took part in from the preparation down to the actual event with organizations helping out with the likes of the 
						Sinagtala Circle and Student Body Association (SBA). From these occurrences, values in light of the themes were fostered and given much attention.</p>
				</div>
	</div>		
		
				<div class="main-article-continued">
						<p>Given the fact that the school also promotes Community Involvement Program (CIP), the themes were 
						also made apparent through the programs and the activities done in this sector headed by the officers of the CIP together with selected students.</p>
						<p>The school also further strengthens the advocacy of the themes through the Catechism Program in which the students partake in.</p>
						<p>While yes, it is true that CKC continues to fulfill the themes integrated for the current school year, 
						one thing is certain, doing so is never an easy task, especially when it comes to the students of the school. 
						This poses a challenge to the school and most especially the CKCians who at times serve as hindrances to upholding the themes in CKC.</p>
						<p>It is only right that these themes be put into full effect on a school that is notable not only for its academic excellence 
						but most especially for its focus on upholding faith-rooted values and its mission of building a community of togetherness among its people. Manifesting the themes spearheaded by the school is our social responsibility as part of this community; 
						after all, they are the foundations of a productive school year. 
						This is the beat of the heart of our school, a rhythm that must keep going.</p>

	<p>Recently, the infamous Esther Margaux “Mocha” Uson drew flak for her remarks questioning the authenticity of the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolt. Though others beg to disagree with her malicious intent, she still continues to fool many Filipinos and misinformation continues to thrive in social media sites. This tells a lot about the current situation of fake news in the country and how historical revisionism continues to plague the nation – an issue that calls for intervention, and one that should start now.</p>
	<p>Social media sites, that of which the youth comprise the majority of, are the main avenues where misinformation initially spreads and included here is the Facebook Blog of Mocha Uson with 5.5 million likes where she made the now-controversial claim. Such a situation proves how fake news can easily spread in the media and trick victims most especially the youth who end up preaching inaccurate information. If not stopped now, the so-called “hope of the nation” as our national hero puts it would also end up being inaccurate. </p>
	<p>This is made all the worse with the Philippines being the country with the highest number of social media users in the world as more users would result to more victims.</p>
	<p>In relation to what has been stated, if this does not stop, Philippine history, as we know it, would be revised and the sacrifices of our historical figures would be put to waste. Countless posts such as false depictions trying to cover up the injustice cases during the Marcos ‘Martial Law’ Regime and the EDSA Revolution being called a product of fake news are just some examples of fallacious claims that try to rewrite our past. With information of what actually transpired in our history being covered up, then as they say, history is bound to repeat itself.</p>
	<p>Lastly, if interventions are not put forth, then the effectivity of our laws would be put to question. While yes, it is true that the Senate Bill No. 1492 or An Act Penalizing the Malicious Distribution of False News and Other Related Violations has been approved by President Rodrigo Duterte, fake news still continues to run rampant in the media and the purveyors are still free of charge just like the case of Mocha Uson who is ironically the Assistant Presidential Communications Secretary. If this continues to be the case, then the assurance of stopping of fake news is still a long way to go, hence, the much-needed call for more interventions.  </p>
	<p>Putting the rise of misinformation to a halt is needed now more than ever because if not, its drastic effects will come to fruition such as creating mass hysteria, confusion, and historical revisionism. Fake news nowadays garners a lot of attention and the same case should also go for the interventions that aid in suppressing them. As for how this will be, we should not only depend on the government, starting it in ourselves is also a must – being careful when sharing posts, thinking twice before we click, and by spreading awareness are simple ways in which we can help. By doing so, the truth will prevail in this age of deception. </p>

				<center><h1 id="title3">Dragging Down Illegal Drugs</h1></center>
				<center><h4>By Ymarc Immanuel Manzano</h4></center>
	<p>With the recent increase in drug-related cases among students and teachers, the Department of Education (DepEd) has issued a memorandum directing mandatory drug testing in public schools. 
	In support of the government’s campaign against illegal drugs, this will prove to be effective and of great relevance.</p>
	<p>First off, since these schools have health-related subjects, especially for the Senior High which is the primary target of the said memorandum, 
	not only will these subjects be bound by mere definitions alone, but it will be put into maximum effect giving students and teachers the much 
	needed information and experience. This is in line with the K-12 Program which aims to improve the quality education  and  its experience in our country.</p>
	<p>Moving on, this will also provide awareness on the current situation of our country regarding health issues 
	particularly on mental health that many overlook with drug abuse as a serious mental health problem, which is how the Department of Health (DOH) puts it. 
	This is the reason as to why DepEd with the coordination of DOH, aims to help not only students, but also teachers in their problems since this is an issue which could possibly hinder their capability of learning and teaching.</p>
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="third-article-continued">
	<p>	And lastly, these drug tests will prove beneficial mostly for the welfare of the students especially in this time of vulnerability. 
	Although not to generalize, but in most cases of illegal drug users, they have also been linked to other crimes according to recent statistics. 
	With this in hand, a student may be put into harm, and that is where this drug test will be put into play since after the verification 
	that the teacher is involved in drug-related cases, they are to be removed from their profession.</p>
	<p>For cases where in the student is the one involved, they are to be provided with the right assistance and medication, so as to not put their selves more at risk.</p>
	<p>Basing from all of these, this memorandum will be of great help in aiding one of the most relevant problems that our country is facing right now – illegal drugs.
	In this way, not only the future of the students but it is also taking into account the effect of it among teachers that are put into consideration. 
	We should not only depend on the government’s actions, but we should also start putting  this problem to a halt by starting from ourselves by 
	supporting information campaigns, not taking part in illegal activities, and most importantly, just simply following the law. 
	Through this, we can drag down the rise of illegal drugs in this country.</p>
